Thu Bui (Hong Minh Thu Bui) earned her Bachelor's degree with Honors in Computer Science and Mathematics from Trinity College in 2021, under the mentorship of Professors Ryan Pellico and Ewa Syta. Currently a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Purdue University, working with Professor Bruno Ribeiro, she focuses on research in GNNs, deep learning, and out-of-distribution (OOD) problems in computer vision. Her work aims to improve the efficiency and performance of GNN models by incorporating randomness as an alternative to end-to-end training. Thu is also passionate about enhancing OOD robustness in deep neural networks by leveraging domain knowledge, such as transformation invariances.
